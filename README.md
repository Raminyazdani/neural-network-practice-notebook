# Neural Network from Scratch: MNIST Digit Classifier

A neural network implementation from scratch using NumPy for MNIST digit classification.

## Overview

This project will implement a two-layer neural network to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset, using only NumPy for the core implementation.

## Goals

- Implement forward and backward propagation from scratch
- Use vectorized NumPy operations
- Achieve competitive accuracy on MNIST
- Educational demonstration of neural network fundamentals

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- scikit-learn (for data loading)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Setup

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Status

🚧 In Development
