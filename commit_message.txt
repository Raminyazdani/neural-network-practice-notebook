Ramin Yazdani | Neural Network MNIST Classifier | main | WIP(data): Add MNIST data loading with notebook structure

Created initial mnist_classifier.ipynb notebook with MNIST data loading infrastructure.
This establishes the foundation of the ML pipeline by implementing data acquisition
and basic structure setup.

What was added:
- mnist_classifier.ipynb notebook file
- Imports: numpy, sklearn.datasets.fetch_openml, train_test_split, OneHotEncoder
- Data loading using fetch_openml('mnist_784')
- Markdown documentation for data loading section
- Basic notebook structure with cells

Rationale: Start with the data pipeline first - verify that data can be loaded
and is in the right format before implementing any model logic. The data loading
is the foundation of any machine learning project.
