Ramin Yazdani | Neural Network MNIST Classifier | main | WIP(deps): Add requirements.txt with project dependencies

Created requirements.txt defining all project dependencies with version constraints.
This ensures reproducibility and makes it clear what packages are needed before
writing any code that imports these libraries.

Dependencies added:
- numpy>=1.21.0 - Core numerical operations and vectorized math
- scikit-learn>=1.0.0 - Dataset loading (fetch_openml for MNIST)
- matplotlib>=3.3.0 - Visualization capabilities
- jupyter>=1.0.0 - Interactive notebook environment

These are the minimal dependencies needed for a from-scratch neural network
implementation using NumPy with MNIST data loading from scikit-learn.
