Ramin Yazdani | Neural Network MNIST Classifier | main | feat(portfolio): Add project identity documentation for portfolio

Created comprehensive project identity documentation to capture all metadata needed
for portfolio presentation and GitHub repository configuration.

What was added:
- project_identity.md with complete project metadata:
  - Professional display title: "Neural Network from Scratch: MNIST Digit Classifier"
  - Repo slug suggestion: neural-network-mnist-numpy
  - Tagline highlighting clean NumPy implementation
  - GitHub description (optimized for repo description field)
  - Primary stack: Python, NumPy, Jupyter Notebook
  - 10 relevant topics/keywords for GitHub topics
  - Problem statement and approach explanation
  - Inputs and outputs documentation

Purpose: This file serves as the source of truth for how this project should be
presented across different platforms (GitHub, portfolio site, resume). All
descriptions and metadata are aligned with the professional, portfolio-ready
nature of the project.

The project is now complete and ready for portfolio use.
