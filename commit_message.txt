Ramin Yazdani | Neural Network MNIST Classifier | main | feat(docs): Improve notebook markdown cells with detailed descriptions

Enhanced markdown cells in mnist_classifier.ipynb to provide clear, professional
documentation within the notebook itself. This makes the notebook more educational
and easier to understand.

What was updated (4 markdown cells):
- Cell 0: Updated title to "MNIST Digit Classifier: Two-Layer Neural Network"
  - Added clear project description emphasizing from-scratch implementation
  - Professional tone replacing any instructional language
- Cell 1: Added "## Data Loading and Preprocessing" section header
  - Enhanced description of data loading and preprocessing steps
- Cell 3: Added "## Neural Network Implementation" section header
  - Implementation notes explaining architecture decisions
  - Listed key components (activations, forward/backward propagation)
- Cell 5: Added "## Model Training and Evaluation" section header
  - Described training process and expected accuracy
  - Professional formatting with clear structure

Result: In-notebook documentation now matches the quality of the README, making
the notebook both educational and professional.
