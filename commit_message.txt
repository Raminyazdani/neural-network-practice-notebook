Ramin Yazdani | Neural Network MNIST Classifier | main | WIP(training): Implement training loop and prediction functionality

Implemented the training loop and prediction method to complete the neural network
functionality. The model can now be trained on data and make predictions.

What was added:
- train(X, y, epochs, learning_rate) method:
  - Loops over epochs performing forward pass, loss computation, and backpropagation
  - Updates weights using gradient descent: W -= learning_rate * dW
  - Prints loss every 10 epochs for progress monitoring
- predict(X) method:
  - Runs forward propagation
  - Returns predicted class labels (argmax of softmax probabilities)
- Training and evaluation cells in notebook

Known issue: Learning rate set to 0.05 which is too low. This will cause slow
convergence and suboptimal accuracy (~50% instead of expected 90%). Will be
fixed in next commit after testing reveals the problem.
