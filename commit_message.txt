Ramin Yazdani | Neural Network MNIST Classifier | main | WIP(preprocessing): Add data preprocessing: normalization and train/test split

Completed the data preprocessing pipeline with normalization and train/test split.
Normalization scales pixel values to [0, 1] range which is critical for neural
network training convergence. Train/test split enables proper model evaluation.

What was added:
- Pixel normalization: [0, 255] → [0, 1] by dividing by 255.0
- Train/test split using sklearn's train_test_split
- Split ratio: 80% training (56,000 samples), 20% test (14,000 samples)
- random_state=42 for reproducibility
- Data shape verification prints

Rationale: Normalization prevents gradient explosion and ensures stable training.
The train/test split is standard ML practice for unbiased model evaluation.
All data preprocessing is now complete before model implementation.
