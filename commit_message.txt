Ramin Yazdani | Neural Network MNIST Classifier | main | WIP(init): Initial commit: Create basic README

Created minimal README.md with project title and placeholder description.
This establishes the repository with basic project overview and sets the foundation
for future development. The README provides initial context about the neural network
implementation goals before any code is written.

What was added:
- README.md with project title
- Placeholder description mentioning from-scratch neural network implementation
- Basic project overview structure

Next steps will add version control configuration and dependencies.
