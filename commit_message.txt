Ramin Yazdani | Neural Network MNIST Classifier | main | feat(fix): Fix evaluation: correct variable name X_test

Fixed variable name typo in evaluation code discovered when running the notebook.
The variable is named `X_test` (from preprocessing), not `X_testing`.

What was changed:
- predictions = model.predict(X_testing) → predictions = model.predict(X_test)

Problem: Running the evaluation cell threw NameError: name 'X_testing' is not defined

How discovered: Ran notebook cells sequentially, got immediate error on evaluation
cell. Checked preprocessing cell to see actual variable names, found the variable
is `X_test`.

After fix: Evaluation runs successfully and displays ~90% test accuracy as expected.

This is a typical typo bug that's caught immediately during testing. Shows the
importance of running code incrementally to catch errors early.
