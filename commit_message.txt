Ramin Yazdani | Neural Network MNIST Classifier | main | WIP(config): Add .gitignore for Python/Jupyter projects

Added comprehensive .gitignore file with Python and Jupyter Notebook patterns.
This prevents committing build artifacts, cache files, virtual environments, and
IDE-specific files that should remain local.

What was added:
- .gitignore with patterns for:
  - Python bytecode (__pycache__/, *.pyc)
  - Jupyter checkpoints (.ipynb_checkpoints/)
  - Virtual environments (venv/, env/)
  - IDE files (.vscode/, .idea/)
  - Environment variables (.env)

This is standard practice immediately after creating a repository to avoid
accidentally committing unwanted files.
